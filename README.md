## About quora:
It is a question and answer website where questions are asked and answered, edited and organized by the site's users.
It contains many languages, including (Arabic, Hebrew, English, etc.). The headquarters of Quora, the publisher of the site,
is located in Mountain View, California.

The idea of creating the site is based on the fact that most human experiences, knowledge and opinions are still not available on the Internet,
but they are found in books and peopleâ€™s experiences, and only a few of them are found on the Internet.
The Quora website aims to share all the knowledge available in the world by having people contribute to this knowledge base, and to enable everyone to access it
. Whatever the questions, it is possible that there are people who know the answers.

## This homework is about:

The purpose of the site, and we talked about it being a site for questions and inquiries. 
We also explained its purpose, what are the services of this site, and its address
. We talked about what the business category is and does the site design communicate that, 
does the site design achieve the necessary purpose, who are the target users of the site, and we also conducted a time test.
How long does it take to load the page, can the information be found easily, does it provide a search button, have we tested the links, 
and does the web browser work in different browsers and on all devices? We talked about all this, and you can watch this mission.
